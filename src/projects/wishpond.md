I have been the sole maintainer of the Wishpond marketing website since 2015 when I created the WordPress theme, which has been used as the base for every redesign.

Since then, I have planned, implemented and managed more than 700 optimization experiments at every level of complexity and have optimized website performance through server and client-side caching, assets minification and lazy loading.

Technology used:

- Docker
- Github Deployment
- PHP
- WordPress
- Sass
- Bootstrap 4
