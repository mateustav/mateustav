Since 2015, I've been in charge of Wishpond's marketing site including its style, theming, style, deploy and more.

I have also planned, implemented and managed more than 700+ A/B tests using jQuery and modern Javascript syntax as well as ran quality assurance protocols to verify these experiments worked as intended.

One of the biggest pain points of the website was that it wasn't as performative as it could have been. I rebuilt the entire website theme to make sure

Technology used:
