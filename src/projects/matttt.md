The site you're seeing right now! As soon as I heard about this static site generator powered by React, I knew it would become the core of my tech stack. The Gatsby framework allowed me to create this crazy fast site and expand it with plugins (while keeping its performance excellent).

Technology used:

- Netlify
- Github Deployment
- Gatsby.js
- FontAwesome 5 Pro
- React Boostrap
