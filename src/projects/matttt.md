The site you're seeing right now! As soon as I heard about this static site generator powered by React, I knew that would've been the core of the tech stack. Gatsby allowed me to create this crazy fast site while let me expand it with the plugins (and still keeping its excellent performance).

Technology used:

- Netlify
- Continuous deployment via GitHub
- Gatsby.js
- React Boostrap
- FontAwesome 5 Pro
