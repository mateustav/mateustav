Built in 2021, this Slack bot turn Slack messages emojis when it finds a match. I chose to use Node.js as I wanted to try out object-oriented programming techniques through modern Javascript syntax (JS classes) as well as try out PostgreSQL for the first time (it's so powerful!)

Technology used:

- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Continuous deployment via GitHub
- Node.js
- Express
- React
- Slack API
