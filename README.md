## Hello and welcome to my GitHub's profile!

I'm Mat (short for Mateus), a full-stack developer and a digital marketer from Vancouver, Canada. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

I currently work at [Dooly](https://www.dooly.ai/) as a front end developer/marketing solutions engineer.

I've recently launched my personal website (powered by Gatsby and GraphQL). The goal is not only to showcase my projects as a web developer but also write about about tech.

## What excites me?

I'm fascinated about performance and user experience. You'll often find me looking for ways to optimize website speed, or writing scripts to automate repetitive parts of the job. And I love Gatsby.
